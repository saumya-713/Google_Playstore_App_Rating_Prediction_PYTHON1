# App Rating Prediction

## Description

**Objective**: The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts app ratings based on various features provided in the dataset.

### Problem Statement

The Google Play Store team is planning to launch a new feature where certain promising apps are boosted in visibility. This boost will manifest in various ways, including:

- Higher priority in recommendation sections such as "Similar apps", "You might also like", and "New and updated games".
- Increased visibility in search results.

This feature aims to give more attention to newer apps that show potential. To help with this process, we need to predict which apps are likely to have high ratings, as app ratings are a great indicator of an appâ€™s quality and appeal.

### Domain

- **General**

### Dataset: Google Play Store Data

The dataset used for this project is called **googleplaystore.csv** and contains various features related to the apps available on the Google Play Store. The following are the fields included in the dataset:
